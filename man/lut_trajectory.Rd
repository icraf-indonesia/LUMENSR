\title{Lookup Table for Land Cover Trajectories}
\format{
A tibble with 8 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{traj_id}{The unique identifier for each land cover trajectory (integer).}
\item{trajectory}{The description of the land cover trajectory corresponding to each
\code{traj_id} (character).}
}
}
\source{
LUMENSR package
}
\usage{
lut_trajectory
}
\description{
The \code{lut_trajectory} tibble contains a lookup table that maps trajectory IDs to their
corresponding land cover trajectory descriptions. This lookup table is used to assign
meaningful labels to the land cover change trajectories identified in the analysis.
}
\details{
The land cover trajectories represented in this lookup table are:
\enumerate{
\item Undisturbed forest: Areas that have remained as undisturbed forest throughout
the analysis period.
\item Logged-over forest: Forest areas that have been subject to logging activities.
\item Monoculture tree-based plantation: Plantations that consist of a single tree
species, typically grown for commercial purposes.
\item Shrub, grass, and cleared land: Areas covered by shrubs, grasslands, or land
that has been cleared of its previous vegetation.
\item Agriculture/annual crop: Land used for agricultural purposes, particularly for
growing annual crops.
\item Mixed tree-based plantation: Plantations that consist of multiple tree species,
often with a mix of commercial and native species.
\item Others: Land cover types that do not fall into any of the other defined
categories.
\item Settlement and built-up area: Areas that have been developed for human
settlement, including urban and rural built-up areas.
}

This lookup table is typically used in conjunction with the land cover change analysis
functions in the LUMENSR package. It helps in assigning meaningful labels to the
identified land cover trajectories, making the results more interpretable.
